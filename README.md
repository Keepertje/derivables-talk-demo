# Derivables Talk Demo

We're going to use derivables to implement a set of
column headers + horizontal scrollbar for a spreadsheet
SPA like Google Sheets. This turns out to be a fairly
interesting example of how derivables can help with
state management in the small.

What you're seeing now probably represents the finished
product, so go back to the first commit and do the
following:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    open build/index.html
    grunt

- Quick look at `src/utils.ts`
- Look at `src/main.tsx`
- Move forward in the commit history, refreshing
  build/index.html in your browser to see the new
  states. Don't forget to read the commit messages
  to see what's going on.
